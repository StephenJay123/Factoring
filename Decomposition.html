    <h3 class="Definition3">How To Solve:</h3>
    <h4 class="Steps">The first step in factoring through Decomposition is to factor anything out before you start. <br> This is done by taking out the greatest common factor and putting it in brackets outside of the terms.</h4>

    <h4 class="Steps">The second step in Decomposition is to find two numbers that multiply into a times c and add into b.</h4> 
    <img src="DecompositionSecondStep.png" alt="Second Decomposition Step" class="Image2">
    <h4 class="Steps">Once you have found these numbers, swap them for b in the equation.</h4>
    <img src="DecompositionThirdStep.png" alt="Second Decomposition Step" class="Image2">
    <h4 class="Steps">The third step in Decomposition is to find two pairs of the four numbers that have the highest GCF together. <br> You can swap numbers around if necessary to find the best order.</h4>

    <h4 class="Steps">After you have found these pairs, put them in brackets together and factor out the GCF of each pairing <br> if there is no GCF, place a 1 before the bracket.</h4>

    <h4 class="Steps">You should notice the terms in brackets match eachother, if they are opposites factor out a negative on one of the brackets. <br> After the brackets match, create two pairs of brackets placing the common bracket as one of them <br> And for the second bracket add the first GCF and Second GCF together.</h4>

    <h4 class="Steps">Finally, if there is anything able to be factored, factor it out. <br> After that, what remains is your final answer!</h4>
