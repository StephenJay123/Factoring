    <h3 class="Definition3">How To Solve:</h3>
    <h4 class="Steps">The first step in factoring with Difference of Squares is to put the square root of a at the front of the two brackets <br> Follow this up by getting the square root of b and adding it to a in the first bracket and subtracing it from a in the second.</h4>

    <h4 class="Steps">In the example above, that is the final answer. </h4>

    <h4 class="Steps"> In some cases, you will need to factor additionally to get the answer. <br> Here's an example of a case where you will need to use Difference of Squares twice.</h4>
    <img src="DOSSecondStep.png" alt="Third Difference of Squares Step" class="Image2">
    <h4 class="Steps">In this case we will do difference of squares on the second brackets as that contains the negative. <br> Factor again by following the previous steps.</h4>

    <h4 class="Steps">Continue to factor until you are unable to factor anymore, that is when you reach your answer.</h4>
